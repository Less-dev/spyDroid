    <p>
      Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to view and interact with a virtual desktop environment running on another computer on the network.
      Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine and send only the display from these applications to your local device.
      This package contains a client which will enable you to connect to other desktops running a VNC server.
      VNC is platform-independent and supports various operating systems and architectures as both servers and clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      TigerVNC is a high-speed version of VNC based on the RealVNC 4 and X.org code bases.
      TigerVNC started as a next-generation development effort for TightVNC on Unix and Linux platforms, but it split from its parent project in early 2009 so that TightVNC could focus on Windows platforms.
      TigerVNC supports a variant of Tight encoding that is greatly accelerated by the use of the libjpeg-turbo JPEG codec.
