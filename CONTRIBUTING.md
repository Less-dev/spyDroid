# Code Style

* Complex and non-obvious functionality must be properly commented.
* Your code's style should match the existing and surrounding code style.

# Pull Requests
* DON't submit one huge commit with all changes, DO try to make commits as atomic as possible.
* DO prefix commits messages with subsystem touched, for example "config: added new key".
* DON'T end commit messages with a period.
* DO formulate commit messages so they complete the sentence "When applied, this commit will ...".
